### Philosophy

We believe in open data. Our scripts may be too technical for the average reader, but we make it accessible because we believe it is important to be as transparent as possible about our methodology so our work can be checked or expanded upon. 

Check out the reproducible scripts and data behind many of our other stories in our [central repo](https://github.com/trendct/data)
